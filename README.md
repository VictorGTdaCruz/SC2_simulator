  I do not own Starcraft or anything related to it. All rights belong to Blizzard Entertainment. 
  
  The reason I'm making this app is to practice android basics and OO programming logic. The simulator is so I can think of different openings and test their efficiency in the very early game while I'm away from my computer and try to implement them when back home.
  
  This is not a game. It just simulates some game numbers, like time, resources and supply. The main goal is to simulate Starcraft2 LotV early game (0 to 4~5 min) while there is no pvp interference. Game mechanics like unit/structure production and income are present.
